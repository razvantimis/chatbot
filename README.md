## Features

The bot will query [WikiData](https://www.wikidata.org) for anything you send it. If it finds a single entity, it will print out the facts that Wikidata holds on the entity. If it finds multiple entities, it will offer a sequence of buttons for the users to select between matching entities, and then print out the facts from about the selected object. 

Try, for example, typing in 'David Hasselhof', or just 'David'.

## Privacy

This bot keeps no user information.
